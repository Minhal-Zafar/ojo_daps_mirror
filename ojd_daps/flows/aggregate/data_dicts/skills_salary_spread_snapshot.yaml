description: >-
  The median and quartiles (lower and upper) of annualised advertised job salaries by skills mentioned in the job description. Salaries are typically advertised as a range (£`MIN`-£`MAX`). This creates two salary series: the lower values from these ranges (`MIN`), and the upper values (`MAX`). In instances where a single salary is given we assign both £`MIN` and £`MAX` to be equal to the single salary.
