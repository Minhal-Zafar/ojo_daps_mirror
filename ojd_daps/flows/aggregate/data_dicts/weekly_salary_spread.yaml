description: >-
  The median and quartiles (lower and upper) of annualised advertised job salaries, on a given Monday, including the total sum of job advertisments in the 6 week period leading up to the given date stamp.
  Salaries are typically advertised as a range (£`MIN`-£`MAX`). This creates two salary series: the lower values from these ranges (`MIN`), and the upper values (`MAX`). In instances where a single salary is given we assign both £`MIN` and £`MAX` to be equal to the single salary.
