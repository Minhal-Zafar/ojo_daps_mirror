# Skills taxonomy table

The file `clusters_v02_1_frequent_forms` contains the taxonomy of skills and surface forms
that corresponds to the skills detection algorithm model version `v02_1`

Columns with `cluster_0` corresponds to Level 1 categories described in the project blog (`cluster_1` corresponds to Level 2 etc.)

For each Level 3 category (`cluster_2`) we also show the top-most frequent surface forms
